## Summary
This paper discusses the concept of "believable characters" in arts and how it applies to artificial intelligence and agents.

## Key Concepts

### Believable Character
- Does not mean honest or reliable character
- Permits the audience's suspension of disbelief
- Provides the illusion of life

### Historical Context
- The idea has been studied in literature, drama, theater, film, radio and other media
- Disney animators made great strides toward creating believable characters in 1930s
- Classic Disney animation reference work begins with these enormous words

### AI Perspective
Many AI researchers have long wished to build intelligent agents called "robots" or "agents" that:
- Seem to think, feel, and live
- Could share companionship with humans
- Could act like a continuing friend or social pet

### Key Researchers
- **Woody Bledsoe** (1985 AAAI Presidential Address):
  - Spoke of his continuing dream to build a computer "like a human being"
  - Machine that could "understand, learn, think, dream, enjoy, hate"
  - "I especially liked to walk and play Ping-Pang with me"

### Convergent Dreams
Both animators and AI researchers share dreams of:
- Creating living entities
- Finding creators to care about
- Achieving the essence of life
- Simulating the illusion of life in their medium

### Focus Areas
Traditional AI has gravitated toward qualities like:
- Reasoning
- Problem solving
- Concept formation
- Learning
- Other qualities central to intelligence

### Character Animation Requirements
- Animators were forced to be especially analytic
- Had to produce the illusion of life from nothing more than individual, hand-drawn, flat-shaded line drawings
- Practical requirement of producing thousands of these drawings frame by frame
- Could not rely on human actor
- Required extremely simple, nonrealistic imagery
- Had to seek and abstract precisely that which was crucial to portray the character
