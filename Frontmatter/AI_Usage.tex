\section*{Use of Artificial Intelligence}

During the preparation of this thesis we used artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist with drafting, editing, literature discovery, and code generation. Specifically, large language models (LLMs) were used to suggest rewrites and clarifications of prose, to generate candidate literature search queries and summaries, and GitHub Copilot was used as a coding assistant to propose code snippets and refactorings. All AI-assisted text and code suggestions were reviewed, edited, and validated by the authors. The authors take full responsibility for the final content, claims, and conclusions presented in this thesis.

We have followed DTU's guidance on the responsible use of AI in academic work: we disclose the role of each tool and model version, and we maintain the key system prompts that materially influenced outputs (for example, the redaction agent prompt and the coding assistant configuration), together with representative examples of AI-assisted transformations. Given the volume and interactive nature of AI use, we do not log every query. Any factual assertions, citations, or technical methods suggested by AI were checked against primary sources before inclusion. This disclosure is provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility in line with university policy (see: \url{https://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/en/publishing/reference-management/kunstig-intelligens/eksempler}).
