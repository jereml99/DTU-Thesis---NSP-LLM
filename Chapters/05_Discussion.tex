Discussion and interpretation of findings.

\section{Limitations}

Our evaluation is subject to several important constraints. The participant pool of 10 to 15 subjects limits statistical power and generalizability of believability findings. More critically, this sample size precluded ablation studies that would isolate the independent contributions of symbolic validation, NL condition checking, and replanning mechanics. As a result, we evaluate the neuro-symbolic system as an integrated whole rather than identifying which individual components drive improvements in coherence and believability. Future work should employ larger participant cohorts and factorial designs to disentangle component contributions and strengthen causal claims about architectural design choices.
