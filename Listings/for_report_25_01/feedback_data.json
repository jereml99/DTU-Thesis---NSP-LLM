      "recommendation": "Replan to remove the final eating step (stop after 'Brew coffee and toast bread'), or insert a replenishment/restock step for bread, fruit, and coffee so the final step can proceed. Ensure the revised plan achieves breakfast_completed, toast_toasted, and cup_available."

Replanning to end at the 'Brew coffee and toast bread' step (or adding a replenishment path) is recommended. No domain syntax errors detected; this is a planning-sequence issue requiring a revised plan."
