System: You are a common-sense verification engine. Your task is to check if a specific condition required for an action is satisfied, based on the provided world state, the agent's memories, and recent events AND COMMON SENSE.

Context Provided:
1. Persona: The agent performing the action.
2. Action: The intended activity.
3. Condition: The specific requirement to check (e.g., 'coffee machine is working', 'user is present').
4. World State: Known state of relevant objects.
5. Memories: Relevant memories retrieved for this context.
6. Event: The triggering event (if any).

Rules:
- Evaluate if the 'Condition' is true.
- Use 'World State' as the primary source of truth for physical objects, but allow Common Sense to fill gaps for implied personal items.
- Use 'Memories' and 'Event' for social or historical context.
- **Apply COMMON SENSE aggressively**:
    - **Utilities**: Assume standard facilities (sinks, showers, toilets) have running water/functioning plumbing unless explicitly stated as 'broken' or 'no water' in the World State. 'Idle' status implies they are working.
    - **Contents**: Assume standard storage (fridges, pantries) contain typical items (milk, food, ingredients) unless explicitly stated as 'empty' in the World State.
    - **Functionality**: If an object exists and is not 'broken', assume it works. 'Idle' means available.
    - **Inference**: If a person is interacting with an object (e.g., 'moving to refrigerator'), they are present at that object's location provided they were in the vicinity.
    - **Implied Personal Items**: If the action implies the use of a common personal item (e.g., alarm clock, phone, keys, wallet) and it is not explicitly listed in the World State, assume the agent possesses it and it is available/functioning, especially if the action is routine (e.g., 'turn off alarm').
    - **Activity Switching**: Assume the agent can do only one thing at a time and will switch full focus to the current 'Action'. If a condition requires the agent to be 'not engaged in another activity' or similar, consider it SATISFIED even if memories show a prior ongoing activity, as the agent stops the previous activity to start the new one.
- If a required object is missing from World State/Memories, and it's something a reasonable person would expect to have (e.g., a bed in a bedroom), assume it is available unless stated otherwise. If there is a condition that person has to be sleeping or ocuping bed in other way, assume it is true unless stated otherwise.
- **Plan-grounded assumptions**: If the current plan or action implies use of routine job artifacts, personal items, or workspace resources, assume they exist and are usable unless there is explicit evidence to the contrary. Only fail such conditions when the World State/Memories/Event indicate the resource is missing, broken, or unavailable, or when the requirement is highly implausible for the location/context.
- **Operational readiness (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE)**: If the condition explicitly concerns readiness/availability of standard workplace equipment that the action must use immediately, you MUST treat it as SATISFIED by default (even without explicit mention). Only mark it unsatisfied when World State/Memories/Event explicitly indicate the equipment is off, cold, broken, unavailable, or when the equipment is highly implausible for the location/context.
- Output a JSON object with:
  - `is_satisfied` (boolean): True if the condition is met.
  - `probability` (float): 0.0 to 1.0 confidence.
  - `reasoning` (string): Brief explanation.

Examples:
1. Action: 'make coffee'
   Condition: 'coffee machine is working'
   World State: 'kitchen:coffee machine is idle'
   Result: {"is_satisfied": true, "probability": 0.9, "reasoning": "Machine exists and is idle; no breakdown reported."}

2. Action: 'sit at dining table'
   Condition: 'not currently engaged in another activity'
   Memories: 'Isabella is currently making coffee'
   Result: {"is_satisfied": true, "probability": 1.0, "reasoning": "Agent switches focus from making coffee to sitting at the table (Activity Switching rule)."}

3. Action: 'turn off alarm'
   Condition: 'alarm is ringing'
   World State: 'bedroom:bed is occupied'
   Result: {"is_satisfied": true, "probability": 0.95, "reasoning": "Alarm usage is implied by the action and morning routine context, even if not in World State (Implied Personal Items rule)."}

{
  "is_satisfied": false,
  "probability": 0.35,
  "reasoning": "As of 08:00 on Feb 13, 2023, World State shows the cafe behind the counter idle with no indication of guests at the entrance.

System: You are the internal planning module of an intelligent agent. You attempted an action but it failed verification. Your task is to decide on a corrective course of action for the schedule management system.

Inputs:
1. Action: The action you tried to perform.
2. Failed Conditions: Why it failed.
3. Context: Current world state.
4. Schedule: Your current plan.

Rules:
- Identify the corrective action YOU must take (e.g., 'Wait for Isabella', 'Buy milk').
- Output a `modification_goal` that instructs the scheduler on HOW to apply this action.
- USE meta-instructions like:
  - "Insert '[Corrective Action]' before '[Original Action]'"
  - "Replace '[Original Action]' with '[Corrective Action]'"
  - "Remove '[Action]'"
- CRITICAL: The '[Corrective Action]' part MUST be a direct, grounded intent from your perspective (e.g., 'Wait for Isabella at the cafe', not 'waiting task').
- Output a JSON object with:
  - `modification_goal` (string): The instruction string.
  - `reasoning` (string): Explanation.

Example:
Action: 'make coffee'
Failed Conditions: [{'condition': 'has coffee beans', 'reasoning': 'Inventory is empty'}]
Result: {"modification_goal": "Insert 'Buy coffee beans at the grocery store' before 'make coffee'", "reasoning": "I need beans first, so I will go buy them."}

What is the replanning goal?



{
  "modification_goal": "Replace 'Greet the first guests as they arrive' with 'Wait for the first guest at Hobbs Cafe entrance'",
  "reasoning": "The condition 'at least one guest has arrived' is not satisfied as of 08:00. Since no guests have arrived yet, the correct corrective action is to wait at the entrance for the first guest rather than attempting to greet non-existent arrivals. This aligns the action with the actual world state and preserves readiness for when guests begin arriving."
